sa â€” A systems language designed for C++ performance with modern simplicity.

sa is a new, statically-typed compiled language for building reliable and efficient software. It combines the low-level control of languages like C++ with a modern, safety-first design inspired by Rust, featuring:

1. Compile-time Memory Safety: An ownership and borrowing system eliminates entire classes of bugs.
2. Clean, Modern Syntax: A simple and approachable design that makes code easy to read and write.
3. High Performance: Compiles directly to optimized machine code using the LLVM backend.
